      <p class="quote">
        “When he took the Argentina job, at the end of his first training session Bielsa handed the players a pencil and a little slip of paper. 
        He wanted them to write down whether they wanted to line up with a back three or a four. 
        He went through all the replies. “Back four, back four, back four… This clearly shows your preference for a line of four. 
        But I’m telling you that from now on we’re going to be playing with a back three. See you tomorrow.” 
        And he won them over, bringing them round to his way of thinking.”
